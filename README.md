🚗 Automotive Software Engineer 🚙 | 📟 Embedded Systems Developer 🌐 | 🦀 Rust Enthusiast 🛠️ | 🔒 Passionate about Cybersecurity 👨🏻‍💻 | 🎮 Game Programming 🕹️

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Automotive Software Engineer with a deep-rooted passion for designing embedded systems that drive innovation on the road in the form of software defined vehicles.
Beyond the automotive realm, I channel my enthusiasm into Rust programming, making systems both efficient and secure. Cybersecurity is a focal point in my work ensuring that technology remains a safe space for all.
During my free time I dive into the exciting world of game programming, turning my passion into pixel-perfect experiences. Explore my repositories and join me on this thrilling coding journey!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on innovative automotive software solutions, pushing the boundaries of embedded systems to enhance driving experiences.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced Rust programming techniques and deepening my knowledge of cybersecurity best practices.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Rust, embedded systems, and game development, where my skills can contribute to exciting endeavors.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with scaling my rust game engine (on top of bgfx) up to other platforms like iOS; any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to automotive software development, Rust programming, cybersecurity or game and graphics programming. I'm here to share knowledge and ideas!
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on GitHub for collaboration and discussions. You can also reach out via [![Linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=flat-square&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/constantin-groelle/)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: While modern computing progresses into adding more layers, more complexity (and more bloat) to software, I feel only at ease when coding on vintage platforms like Windows 2000 and Visual C++ 6.0. There's an inexpressible magic in retro computing that makes it so much more enjoyable and rewarding than modern software development to me
